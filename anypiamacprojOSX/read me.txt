// Read Me.txtThis is a straight conversion to OS X (and OS 9) of the social security benefitcalculator at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ANYPIA/source.htmlThere is no warranty. Use at your own risk.This compiles with Metrowerks Codewarrior 9.3.To compile it, you'll need to download oactobjs.sea from http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ANYPIA/source.html, unpack it, and put the resulting oactobjs folder next to the anypiamacprojOSX folder (the folder that contains this file).My work on this program is hereby placed in the public domain.David Phillip Oster April 25, 2005
